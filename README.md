<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sean</h1> <br>
I'm a 16 year old full-stack developer from Michigan. I'm interested in learning development in Java, Javascript, and Golang-based libraries. Currently, I am learning TensorFlow and OpenCV for Java,  and I am the lead student developer for the Otsego High Schools FRC Robotics team. In my free time, I work on lots of random projects, such as my Javascript-based game website designed for hosting on low-powered hardware, codenamed Project Aperture. <br>
